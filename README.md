# Car Brand Classifier: BMW vs. Lexus

## Overview

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can distinguish between BMW and Lexus car images. We leverage Transfer Learning using VGG16 to improve the model's efficiency and accuracy. 

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Image augmentation
- Model training using Transfer Learning with VGG16
- Model evaluation and testing

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages either globally or in a virtual environment.
3. Run the main script to train the model.
4. Optionally, test the model using untrained images.

## Results

The model performs remarkably well with an accuracy of over 80%. It successfully identifies BMW cars in all test cases and shows a very low error rate on Lexus cars.
